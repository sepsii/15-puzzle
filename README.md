# Selected-Geeks Interview - Sepehr Sharifi - 2023 
This is a project I created for an interview with GitHub. It's a puzzle game similar to the classic 15 puzzle, but with the added twist that it allows for different numbers of columns and rows.

# Puzzle Validation 

One important note is that the puzzle validation (if a puzzle is solvable or if it is solved) may not work properly due to the complexity of allowing for different inputs for rows and columns. Unfortunately, I was unable to find adequate support for this issue online, and the short deadline for the interview made it difficult to fully address this challenge.
